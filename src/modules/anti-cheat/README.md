# Anti-Cheat System Documentation

## Overview

The comprehensive anti-cheat system provides server-side validation of puzzle solutions with sophisticated cheat detection mechanisms, manual review processes, appeal systems, and community moderation features.

## Features

### 1. Server-Side Solution Validation
- **Real-time validation**: All puzzle solutions are validated server-side
- **Multi-layer detection**: Combines timing analysis, move sequence validation, and statistical analysis
- **Puzzle type support**: Works with all puzzle types (Sudoku, sliding puzzles, etc.)

### 2. Anti-Cheat Detection Mechanisms

#### Timing Analysis
- Detects impossibly fast solution times
- Analyzes move frequency and patterns
- Identifies inhuman response times
- Considers puzzle difficulty and user skill level

#### Move Sequence Verification
- Validates logical move progressions
- Detects impossible state transitions
- Checks for valid puzzle rules compliance
- Identifies automated/scripted solutions

#### Statistical Analysis
- Monitors player performance patterns
- Detects sudden skill improvements
- Analyzes long-term behavioral trends
- Identifies outliers and anomalies

#### Pattern Recognition
- Detects repetitive timing patterns
- Identifies bot-like behavior
- Recognizes solution copying
- Monitors device/browser fingerprints

### 3. Detection Confidence Levels
- **Low (0.0-0.3)**: Flagged for monitoring
- **Medium (0.3-0.7)**: Requires manual review
- **High (0.7-0.9)**: Automatic penalties applied
- **Critical (0.9-1.0)**: Immediate action taken

### 4. Manual Review System
- **Automated assignment**: High-confidence detections automatically queued
- **Priority levels**: Critical, high, medium, low
- **Review workflow**: Assignment → Investigation → Decision
- **Evidence collection**: Comprehensive data for reviewers

### 5. Appeal Process
- **Transparent appeals**: Clear process for contesting decisions
- **Evidence submission**: Users can provide supporting evidence
- **Fair review**: Independent review of appeals
- **Quick resolution**: Expedited process for obvious false positives

### 6. Community Moderation
- **User reporting**: Community can report suspicious behavior
- **Collaborative moderation**: Community involvement in fair play
- **Report tracking**: Comprehensive report management
- **Feedback loop**: Results inform detection improvements

### 7. Analytics and Improvement
- **Performance tracking**: Monitor false positive/negative rates
- **Detection optimization**: Continuous improvement of algorithms
- **Reporting dashboard**: Real-time analytics for administrators
- **Trend analysis**: Long-term pattern recognition

## Database Schema

### CheatDetection
- Stores detected cheating incidents
- Includes confidence scores and evidence
- Tracks review status and outcomes

### ManualReview
- Manages the manual review process
- Assigns reviews to moderators
- Tracks review progress and decisions

### Appeal
- Handles user appeals of detections
- Stores evidence and review outcomes
- Manages appeal workflow

### CommunityReport
- Community-generated reports
- Moderator investigation tracking
- Resolution status and outcomes

## Configuration

### Detection Thresholds
```typescript
const DETECTION_THRESHOLDS = {
  TIMING_ANOMALY: {
    MIN_SOLUTION_TIME: 10000, // 10 seconds minimum
    MAX_MOVE_FREQUENCY: 100,  // Max moves per second
  },
  STATISTICAL_OUTLIER: {
    PERFORMANCE_DEVIATION: 3, // Standard deviations
    IMPROVEMENT_RATE: 0.5,    // Max improvement rate
  },
  PATTERN_RECOGNITION: {
    REGULARITY_THRESHOLD: 0.8, // Timing regularity
    SEQUENCE_SIMILARITY: 0.9,  // Move sequence similarity
  },
};
```

### Severity Levels
```typescript
enum CheatSeverity {
  LOW = 'low',
  MEDIUM = 'medium',
  HIGH = 'high',
  CRITICAL = 'critical',
}
```

## Integration Guide

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install @nestjs/typeorm typeorm
```

### 2. Import Module
```typescript
import { AntiCheatModule } from './modules/anti-cheat/anti-cheat.module';

@Module({
  imports: [AntiCheatModule],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

### 3. Run Migrations
```bash
npm run migration:run
```

### 4. Configure Services
```typescript
// In your puzzle controller
constructor(
  private readonly antiCheatService: AntiCheatDetectionService,
) {}

// Validate solution
const validation = await this.antiCheatService.validatePuzzleSolution(solutionData);
if (validation.cheatDetected && validation.confidence > 0.8) {
  throw new HttpException('Cheating detected', HttpStatus.BAD_REQUEST);
}
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Gradual Implementation
- Start with logging-only mode
- Gradually increase sensitivity
- Monitor false positive rates
- Adjust thresholds based on data

### 2. User Experience
- Minimize impact on legitimate players
- Provide clear feedback for violations
- Ensure appeal process is accessible
- Maintain transparency in decisions

### 3. Security Considerations
- Never expose detection algorithms
- Regularly update detection methods
- Monitor for evasion attempts
- Implement rate limiting on appeals

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use background processing for analysis
- Implement efficient database queries
- Monitor system resource usage

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Key Metrics
- False positive rate
- False negative rate
- Detection accuracy
- Appeal success rate
- System performance

### Alerts
- High false positive rates
- Detection system failures
- Unusual cheating patterns
- Appeal backlog buildup

## Testing

### Unit Tests
```bash
npm run test src/modules/anti-cheat
```

### Integration Tests
